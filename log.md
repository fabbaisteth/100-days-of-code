# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 15, 2024 
##### Working on Shardeum Hackathon Project

**Today's Progress**: Setup the project structure contracts/frontened. Deployed an ERC1155 to testnet and researched how to build a factory or vault to make raising and maintaining the ERC1155 convenient. 
**Thoughts:** Really struggled to get back into the syntax, been a few weeks since I last touched Solidity. I generally feel like I'm quite bad at seeing and making the right abstractions quickly.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
