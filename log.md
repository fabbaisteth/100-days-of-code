# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 15, 2024 
##### Working on Shardeum Hackathon Project

**Today's Progress**: Setup the project structure contracts/frontened. Deployed an ERC1155 to testnet and researched how to build a factory or vault to make raising and maintaining the ERC1155 convenient. 
**Thoughts:** Really struggled to get back into the syntax, been a few weeks since I last touched Solidity. I generally feel like I'm quite bad at seeing and making the right abstractions quickly.

### Day 1: April 16, 2024
##### Working on the Hackathon Project and setting up Avail Node

**Today's Progress**: I set up a Taiko node and the service to run it in the background of the VPS. On the other front, played with the Alchemy pre-built NFT marketplace. Will adapt the code for the needs of my hacktathon project tomorrow.
**Thoughts:** it didn't feel like I did much today, felt very distracted and it also shows in lines of code or better the lag thereof. Need to reserve actual focus time to push and make these days productive. 


### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
